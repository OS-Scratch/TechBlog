# What is Scratch?
Scratch is a block-based programming language developed by MIT and the Lifelong Kindergarten Group. You can create code with it by snapping blocks together to shape a program.
# How did I discover Scratch?
I discovered Scratch some years ago, as an introduction to programming. I was amazed by the creative possibilities that it opened. So I set up my account and started _scratching_ (a verb used by users of Scratch. meaning: to code in Scratch). Even though a long time has passed, I still enjoy coding my OSs.
# Why Scratch?
Scratch opens up a palette of various ideas and boosts creativity. Although it is not the best language for complex apps and programs, it still plays an important role in children's education and also serves as an easy introduction to coding. You can also upgrade Scratch's capabilities with Extensions, of which more are available in <a href="https://turbowarp.org">TurboWarp</a>.
